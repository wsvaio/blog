# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root, or
- **`CONTEXT-MAP.md`** at the repo root if it exists: it points at one `CONTEXT.md` per context. Read each one relevant to the topic.
- **`docs/adr/`**: read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in. In multi-context repos, also check `src/<context>/docs/adr/` for context-scoped decisions.

If any of these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. The `/domain-modeling` skill creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## File structure

This repo uses the single-context layout:

```
/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/adr/
└── app/
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When output names a domain concept, use the term defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If a needed concept isn't in the glossary, reconsider whether the language fits the project or note the gap for `/domain-modeling`.

## Flag ADR conflicts

If output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding.
